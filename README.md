# RealTimeBusTracker_Chicago

## About the Project
This program uses the Mapbox API and the Chicago Transit Authority's Bus Tracker API to track all buses on the CTA's Route #66 Chicago Avenue Bus. The tracker updates every 60 seconds and the markers on the map move as the bus locations change.

This is a practice activity for MITx Pro's Web Development Class. The purpose of this activity is to get familiar with using API's to create a dynamic web page. 

## What's Next
In the future, I would like to add colors to show which buses are going in which directions, and potentially allow the user to select which routes or directions the program tracks as well.

## License
This program was made with files from MIT x Pro's course. More information can be found in the LICENSE file.
